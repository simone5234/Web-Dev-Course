# About my projects from my IST 250 web development course
I completed 3 different web development projects over the course of my spring 2024 semester.    
The first project was based on designing a website for a record store business. We learned about the basics involving HTML and JavaScript.    
The second project was about making a website for an imaginary company/business. I chose to do a nail polish website, and we began using Bootstrap during this.  
The practice 2.8 project shows the starting process of what was learned before beginning the nail polish website. We used the example of a pizza company.    
The third project was a more finalized version of our second project, including adding more flexibility regarding accessing the site on different devices.
